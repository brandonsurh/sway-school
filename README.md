# sway-school :zap::school:

Hello! Welcome to SwaySchool. This project contains small exercises to get you reading and writing in Sway. This includes reading and debugging compiler messages!

*SwaySchool is based on the educational project "rustlings" that teaches you how to code in Rust. Check it [out](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings)!*

Alternatively, for a first-time Sway learner, there are several resources provided by Fuel Labs:

- [The Sway Book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.31.3/index.html) - The most comprehensive resource for learning Sway written by Fuel Labs! This will be a great reference for understanding Sway and completing SwaySchool.

- [SwayLang Twitter Page](https://twitter.com/swaylang?lang=en) - This is the twitter account dedicated to Sway. It is full of quick information about Sway, as well as SwayDay episode explaining important concepts!

# What is Sway

Sway is a domain-specific language (DSL) for the Fuel Virtual Machine (FuelVM), a blockchain-optimized VM designed for the Fuel blockchain. Sway is based on Rust, and includes syntax to leverage a blockchain VM without needlessly verbose boilerplate.

Before starting developing smart contracts in Sway, please keep in mind the [known issues and workarounds](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.31.3/reference/known_issues_and_workarounds.html) of the language and toolchain.
